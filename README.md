A simple algorithm to compress images by using k-means clustering to decrease the number of different colours in the images.


## To run,
    $ julia main.jl <image file>  <k>

where k is the number of clusters to use in the k-means algorithm, and results in an image with 2^k distinct colours.





imageKmeans.jl adapted from k-means algorithm provided in assignment.
clustering2Dplot.jl provided from assignment.
